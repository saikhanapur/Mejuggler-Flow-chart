    Employee Performance Review Process - Annual Cycle
    
    Purpose:
    This process ensures consistent, fair, and comprehensive performance evaluations
    for all employees across the organization. The annual review cycle supports
    career development, compensation decisions, and organizational planning.
    
    Process Overview:
    
    Phase 1: Preparation (January - February)
    1. HR sends review schedule and templates to all managers
    2. Employees complete self-assessment forms
    3. Managers gather 360-degree feedback from peers and stakeholders
    4. HR validates completion of required training modules
    
    Phase 2: Review Meetings (March - April)  
    5. Manager conducts initial performance discussion with employee
    6. Employee and manager jointly set goals for upcoming year
    7. Manager completes formal performance rating in system
    8. HR reviews ratings for consistency and bias
    
    Phase 3: Calibration (May)
    9. Department heads participate in calibration meetings
    10. Ratings are adjusted to ensure fairness across teams
    11. Final ratings are approved by senior leadership
    
    Phase 4: Communication (June)
    12. Managers communicate final ratings and development plans
    13. Compensation adjustments are processed by HR
    14. Individual development plans are created and tracked
    
    Key Stakeholders:
    - Employee (review subject)
    - Direct Manager (primary reviewer)
    - HR Business Partner (process oversight)
    - Department Head (calibration)
    - Senior Leadership (final approval)
    - Peer Reviewers (360 feedback)
    
    Current Challenges:
    - Inconsistent rating standards across departments
    - Lengthy calibration process causes delays
    - Limited real-time feedback throughout the year
    - Manual tracking of development plan progress
    - Bias in peer selection for 360 reviews
    
    Success Metrics:
    - 95% completion rate by deadline
    - Manager satisfaction score: 4.1/5.0
    - Employee engagement post-review: 78%
    - Development plan completion: 65%
